<h2>My name is Rony Adi.<br />I became interested in learning coding at the end of 2015.<br /> After knowing the cost to take the bootcamp, I started to adjust the budget to save money to participate in bootcamp coding in the capital city of Indonesia. Alhamdulillah is now realized. Hopefully easy to learn in Hacktiv 8 Indonesia.</h2>
